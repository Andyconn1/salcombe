        <h1>Welcome to 2 Channel View!</h1>
        <p>We are delighted to have you as our guest and hope you have a wonderful and relaxing stay.</p>
        <p>We hope the neighbouring building works don't impact too much on you. We have met with the builders a few times and they try to be as considerate as possible.</p>
        <p>Channel View is our much loved family holiday home since 1977, and now welcomes the fourth generation of the family for their holidays.
            We hope you find the house meets your expectations and you enjoy it as much as we do. </p>
        <p>Over the last three years we have been refurbishing Channel View and hope you find everything in clean and very serviceable condition. We find it helpful if you can contact us directly if there are any problems as we can probably sort things more quickly than Coast and Country. If you find the cleaning is not up to standard or if there are stains or damage noted on arrival, particularly to carpets and soft furnishings, then please tell us. If you unfortunately have accidental damage please tell us, there are some good cleaning products under the sink, or let us know if you feel professional care might be required.</p>
        <p>Just in case the water has been turned off between visitors, the mains tap is behind the cloakroom door, also fridge freezer switch is at the back of the cupboard to its left.
            Heating is controlled near the bottom of the stairs. It is set to a relatively low temperature otherwise when the sun is pouring in the front windows, it really is too warm! It is very easy to control the heat from the Nest thermostat but please contact me if you need me to adjust the programme remotely. Similarly, the bathroom towel rail is set for a morning and evening heat. Please don't try to adjust but send a text or email if you prefer different settings and we can adjust remotely.</p>
        <p>We live in Northumberland and visit out of peak season when we also deep clean. Our cleaners work miracles between guests but cannot do everything so we are grateful if you could leave the house and patio as found. Please don't forget dishwasher filters, dustbins and to clear plugs in kitchen and bathrooms.</p>
        <p>Our neighbours have particularly asked if our guests could be careful if visiting with more than one car, to park according to the instructions on the kitchen window sill. Also to note, all waste goes in the green bin at the bottom of the driveway. Just to remind that the sunroom roof outside the main bedroom window is not a patio. Last season the surface was damaged causing leaks when the rains came later in the year.</p>
        <p>At the start of each season we leave various herbs, spices, oil, vinegar, etc which you are welcome to use but please replace if almost finished so these are available for the next guest. Hopefully there should only be one item for each stay!</p>
        <p>Non slip bath and shower mats are in the cupboard outside the bathroom. Please clean, dry and replace in the cupboard before you leave, if used.</p>
        <p>There are several games to play in the sideboard cupboard, also a few walking maps and map bag. A dustbin outside the back door contains various items to take to the beach or for crab fishing.</p>
        <p>Feel free to contact us anytime. We are only too happy to give recommendations for walks etc as well as answer any house queries.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;All the best,</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Jane and John</p>
